// *shared* editor surface. Real main.ts holds exactly one CodeMirror view
// (editor.ts's module-level `view`, wrapped by editor.content()/.swap()),
// reassigned between docs by activate() (main.ts:560-575), which syncs the
// outgoing doc's buffer from that view *before* handing the surface over to
// the incoming doc. The single-doc harness above bakes "whatever content the
// test wants written" directly into each ipc mock's `writtenContent` —
// sufficient for #124/#161's lock/staleness scenarios, but it never
// exercises *which doc's* content actually gets read in the first place,
// which is exactly what #208 is about: pre-fix, runSaveFlow (main.ts:1572)

// own `original` (issue #161's own fix, mirrored by both saveWithEncoding
// helpers above) — but the .finally() right below it drops
// doc.speculativeEncoding unconditionally, with no such guard. Two
// overlapping Save with Encoding calls each install their own marker (the
// later one replacing the earlier one's — working as intended, same as the
// #161/#210 scenarios above); each also attaches its own independent
// .then().finally() pair to its own saveFlow(false) call. Since .finally()
// never checks whether the marker it's about to null is still its own,
// whichever of the two calls' chains happens to run its .finally() first
// wipes the marker out from under the *other* one — even while that other
// call is still genuinely in flight and still needs it: for its own
// eventual .then() rollback decision (which reads a now-null marker and
// silently skips a rollback it should have performed) and for any reload
// landing in the same window (reloadEncodingFor falls back to doc.encoding
// directly, which at that point is the *other* call's own not-yet-written
// speculative target, not disk truth).
//
// savemutex.ts's own withLock/drainLock nesting (the #124/#161 harness
// above) happens to make this hard to observe through createHarness's own
// issueSave: a request coalesced behind another one via doc.pendingSaveAs
// always has its *entire* .then().finally() chain settle before the request
// it coalesced behind gets to run its own — drainLock is awaited from
// inside withLock's own finally, so the outer call's promise can't resolve
// until everything queued behind it, recursively, already has (see this
// suite's own "real mutex" control test at the bottom, which records and
// pins down that observed order). That's a real property of *today's*
// specific coalescing implementation, but main.ts's own action never
// actually relies on it — that's exactly why its .then() already carries a
// defensive reference-equality check instead of trusting call order — so
// this suite tests the .then().finally() ownership contract directly, by
// controlling each call's own saveFlow(false) stand-in independently. A
// real save's IPC round trip can legitimately settle in either order (a
// big file, a slow disk, or a lossy-encode/stale-file dialog awaiting the
// user can all make one overlapping call outlast another), so the fix must
// hold regardless of which of the two settles first — this suite checks
// both directions rather than assuming one.

// Issue #217 — a critic-review finding against #208's own fix. saveFlow's

// saveFlow's own entry, before deciding whether to run immediately or
// coalesce into doc.pendingSaveAs because something else already holds the
// per-doc lock (issue #124's own mechanism). Pre-fix, drainLock (main.ts's
// drainLock) never reran that gate once the lock actually freed up and it
// was time to run the coalesced request for real via runSaveFlow — so a doc
// that turned read-only *during* the defer window had its now-current
// read-only status silently ignored, and the drained save wrote doc's
// current buffer over the real file regardless.
//
// Constructing a fully causally-realistic reproduction through an actual
// reload turns out to be impossible with today's control flow, not just
// awkward: applyOpenedForReload — the only place doc.truncated is ever set —
// unconditionally clears doc.dirty in that very same synchronous call, and
// nextDrainStep's own save-vs-dropSave choice (savemutex.ts:117-125) is
// re-checked immediately afterward with no async gap in between for a fresh
// edit to land (confirmed by reading both directly rather than assumed). So
// a reload that actually applies and sets truncated=true always leaves
// dirty=false for the very next drain check, which takes dropSave — a real
// write never happens, just not for the reason this issue is about. The
// tests below instead hold the lock with a second in-flight save (this
// suite's own "double-save" skeleton, issue #124's own block above) and flip
// the read-only flag via direct state mutation while the coalesced save sits
// pending — same convention this file already uses for "the user types in
// this window" (issue #124 critic-review P2's own describe block above) —
// isolating the read-only recheck gap itself from whichever exact call chain
// flips the flag. doc.userReadOnly's own toggle (View menu) is in fact
// reachable exactly this directly in production: it's a plain, ungated state
// flip never routed through the save/reload lock at all, so it can land in
// this window for real, not just as a stand-in.
//
// The fix itself lives entirely in savemutex.ts's nextDrainStep (a new
// blockedByReadOnly input, a new rejectBlocked step) — createHarness's own
// drainLock below feeds it a plain isReadOnlyBlocked() predicate and then
// branches on the real step.kind it returns, exactly like main.ts's real
// drainLock does, rather than re-deciding anything on its own. That means
// every scenario below actually exercises production's decision logic, not
// a description of it: stashing savemutex.ts's fix reverts nextDrainStep to
// its pre-#217 branch table and these tests fail for the same reason
// production would. The last scenario below also pins the precedence
// nextDrainStep resolves between dropSave and rejectBlocked when a
// coalesced save is both clean *and* blocked — see nextDrainStep's own doc
// comment for why dropSave must win.
