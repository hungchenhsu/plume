 *
 * Two design choices, both ROADMAP.md v0.7 Track C ("trim trailing
 * whitespace on save", adversarial-review addition) and both verified
 * against node_modules/@codemirror/commands/dist/index.js rather than
 * assumed:
 *
 * 1. Precise per-line `{from, to}` deletions (`computeTrimChanges`, one per
 *    line with a trailing space/tab run), never a single whole-document
 *    replace the way `replaceContent` works. CM6's own change-mapping
 *    (`ChangeDesc.mapPos`, default `assoc: -1`) then keeps the caret stable
 *    for free: a position on an untouched line keeps its exact place
 *    (only shifted by whatever was deleted strictly before it), and a
 *    position that was inside a trimmed run collapses onto that span's
 *    `from` — which is exactly the line's new end, since the span's
 *    replacement is empty. A whole-document replace has no such
 *    correspondence between old and new positions and would instead send
 *    every cursor to one edge of the document.
 * 2. `isolateHistory.of("full")` on the transaction, not
 *    `Transaction.addToHistory.of(false)`. The latter is wrong: a
 *    transaction with `addToHistory === false` still changes the document
 *    but `historyField`'s own `update()` never records it as an event at
 *    all (see the source: `if (tr.annotation(Transaction.addToHistory) ===
 *    false) return ...` — the state's `done` branch is left untouched) —
 *    Undo would skip straight over the trim, and since it's a genuine
 *    content change, there would be no way to get the pre-trim buffer back
 *    via Undo at all.
 *
 *    `isolateHistory` is CM6's own documented annotation for "don't merge
 *    this transaction with a neighboring one" (it calls the history
 *    field's internal `state.isolate()`, which drops `prevTime` — one of
 *    several AND-ed conditions `HistoryState.addChanges` requires before
 *    folding a new event into the previous one; there is no public API for
 *    this beyond the annotation). "full" (both sides) makes the trim
 *    *always* its own undo step, deterministically: the alternative —
 *    letting it merge into the preceding edit via CM6's default
 *    heuristics — was investigated and rejected, because that merge is
 *    gated on conditions this call site cannot reliably control: the two
 *    changes' ranges must be "adjacent" (`isAdjacent`, a structural
 *    overlap check — a trim on line 40 will not merge with an edit on line
 *    3), the elapsed time since the last edit must be under
 *    `newGroupDelay` (500ms by default, and not raisable past whatever
 *    `basicSetup`'s own `history()` call already set — the facet combines
 *    multiple configs' `newGroupDelay` with `Math.min`), and the preceding
 *    event must have no selection-only history entries after it yet (any
 *    cursor move between the user's last edit and hitting Save appends
 *    one). Real usage trips at least one of these constantly — pause
 *    before saving, or click/scroll first — so relying on them would make
 *    Undo's behavior depend on timing and mouse activity nobody could
 *    predict. Isolating instead makes it precise and explainable: one Undo
 *    right after a save always removes exactly the trim (trailing
 *    whitespace comes back, the user's real edits are untouched, and the
 *    tab correctly turns dirty again — disk holds the trimmed bytes but the
 *    buffer no longer matches); the next Undo removes the last real edit,
 *    same as if trim had never run.

// RLI/PDI/in-body-BOM, rendered as a generic "•" placeholder with a

// This extension *overlays* that default via `addSpecialChars` rather

// literally the config field @codemirror/view defines for "highlight
// these too, in addition to the defaults". Overlaying (not replacing)
// keeps CM6's own baseline control-character highlighting (NUL, BS, ESC,
// line/paragraph separators, etc. — none of which are in this project's
// curated list) working unchanged; a full `specialChars` override would
// have silently dropped that unrelated existing behavior for zero
// benefit.
//
// Verified from source that this cannot hit @codemirror/state's
// `combineConfig` "Config merge conflict" error: `specialCharConfig` is a
// Facet whose `combine` runs every contributed config object through

// conflict with, no matter what order the two extensions are combined in.

 * C2). Unlike `lineSpanForSelectionInDoc` above (which throws on an empty
 * selection, since `transformLines` gives a cursor its own whole-document
 * meaning instead), this function handles an empty selection directly:
 * Join Lines' no-selection default is "the current line plus the next
 * one", not "the whole document" — mainstream editor convention (VS Code,
 * Sublime Text, Emacs). A selection already spanning two or more lines
 * joins exactly those lines, using the same line-boundary expansion (and
 * the same to-1 convention, issue #99) as `lineSpanForSelectionInDoc`. A
 * selection confined to a single line — including the degenerate case of
 * no selection at all — instead pulls in the *next* line too, so Join
 * Lines always has at least two lines to merge rather than no-op'ing the
 * way a single-line selection would for `transformLines`. `null` only when
 * that next line doesn't exist: the cursor/selection is already on the
 * document's last line, so there is nothing to join with.
 *
 * A document whose text ends in "\n" has a final, empty CM6 line after it
 * (`Text.lineAt`'s own line-counting model — unlike lineops.ts's
 * string-based `splitLines`, which folds a trailing newline into a boolean
 * flag instead of a phantom last line, see that function's doc comment) —
 * so a cursor on the last line *with content* still has a "next line" to
 * pull in here: the empty one. The span returned for that case is
 * therefore not `null`, even though joining onto an empty line changes
 * nothing; deciding that is lineops.ts's `joinLines`'s job once it sees
 * the sliced text, not this function's — the same division of labor
 * `transformLines` already has with its own no-op-dispatches-nothing
