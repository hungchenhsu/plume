// Core coverage for src/replacescope.ts (ROADMAP.md v0.7 Track C
// "find/replace in selection" [danger]). Two kinds of test here:
//
// 1. Direct unit tests of the scoped-specific semantics (empty selection,
//    multiple ranges, crossing a range boundary, offset bookkeeping) — CM6
//    has no equivalent operation to compare these against, since scoping
//    replace to a selection is exactly the capability CM6 lacks.
// 2. "Consistency with @codemirror/search" tests, which drive the *real*
//    replaceAll/replaceNext commands (from the actual `@codemirror/search`
//    package this app ships) against an unattached `EditorView` — no
//    `parent` element, so no DOM layout pass is ever triggered, which is
//    why this works fine in plain jsdom (confirmed empirically before
//    writing this file: an unattached view's `dispatch` runs its state
//    update synchronously with no measure/layout step). Using a single
//    range spanning the whole document makes `replaceAllInSelection`
//    directly comparable to CM6's own whole-document `replaceAll`, since a
//    match can never cross a "boundary" that is the entire document.
