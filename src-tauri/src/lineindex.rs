//! Line-offset index for huge files: fast go-to-line and bookmarks beyond
//! the loaded chunk window (ARCHITECTURE.md's large-file mode, Track B,
//! ROADMAP.md). `chunk.rs` only knows how to page forward/backward from an
//! already-loaded offset — jumping straight to line 1,234,567 of a
//! multi-gigabyte file would otherwise mean paging through every chunk in
//! between. This module instead builds a sparse index of checkpoint byte
//! offsets (one every `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` lines) by streaming the whole
//! file once, and resolves an arbitrary target line by scanning from the
//! nearest checkpoint — at most `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` lines of bytes per
//! call.
//!
//! Units discipline (large-file offset danger domain, see
//! `.claude/judgment-overlay.md`): every offset in this module is a raw
//! file *byte* offset, never a character or CodeMirror position. Line
//! numbers are always 0-based here, matching `checkpoints[k]` = the byte
//! offset of line `k * CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` (0-based). The frontend owns
//! the 0-based <-> 1-based conversion at the UI boundary (see
//! `src/lineindex.ts`); nothing 1-based ever crosses this IPC boundary.
//!
//! Like `chunk.rs`, this scans raw bytes rather than decoding anything,
//! which is only sound for ASCII-compatible encodings — a literal `0x0A`
//! (LF) or `0x0D` (CR) byte can never appear as part of a multi-byte
//! sequence in any encoding this app supports (UTF-8 continuation bytes are
//! 0x80-0xBF; Big5/Shift_JIS/GB18030/EUC-* lead and trail bytes never dip
//! into the 0x00-0x1F control range either), so byte-level line-break
//! scanning is safe without decoding first. UTF-16 is the one exception
//! (0x0A/0x0D can appear as half of an unrelated code unit) and is rejected
//! up front in `build_line_index`, mirroring `chunk.rs`'s paging exclusion
//! and `streamreplace.rs`'s streaming-encode exclusion. `locate_line_offset`
//! takes no encoding parameter at all: it only ever runs from a checkpoint
//! an already-built (and therefore already UTF-16-checked) index produced.
//!
//! A line is terminated by LF, CRLF, or a lone CR (Classic Mac line
//! endings) — the shared byte-level semantics defined in `linebreak.rs`
//! (matching `encoding::detect_line_ending`'s three-way split, #92), so
//! "how many lines does this file have" agrees everywhere in the app,
//! including `chunk.rs`'s page alignment. CRLF counts as *one* terminator,
//! never two: `linebreak::scan_line_breaks`'s `pending_cr` flag carries
//! across `read_chunk` calls so a `\r\n` pair split across two reads (CR
//! the last byte of one, LF the first byte of the next) is still
//! recognized as a single boundary instead of a lone CR plus a lone LF —
//! the classic streaming-scanner pitfall for CRLF detection.
//!
//! `total_lines` counts every line implied by the byte stream: one for each
//! terminator found (LF, CRLF, or lone CR), plus one more if the file has
//! trailing bytes after the last terminator (or contains no terminator at
//! all). A file that ends exactly on a terminator does *not* get a phantom
//! empty trailing line counted — there is nothing there to jump to, and no
//! checkpoint is ever recorded pointing past end of file.

    // terminator, matching the pre-#92 blind spot in
    // `encoding::detect_line_ending`. A CR-only file was therefore counted
    // as a single line regardless of its real size, breaking Go to Line and
    // bookmarks for Classic Mac line endings. These tests lock the fixed
    // behavior: LF, CRLF (counted once), and lone CR all terminate a line,
    // matching `encoding::detect_line_ending`'s three-way split (#92).
