//! Streaming encoding conversion for large files on disk (ROADMAP.md v0.4
//! Track B "Streaming encoding conversion for large files") [danger]:
//! re-encodes an entire file to a different target encoding via
//! bounded-chunk streaming decode -> re-encode, atomically committed, so
//! memory use stays flat (`O(CHUNK_BYTES)`) regardless of file size --
//! exactly the same architecture as `streamreplace.rs`'s streaming
//! find/replace (same `streamcodec.rs` chunk primitives, same
//! `fsguard.rs`-backed fail-closed external-modification guard, same
//! atomic temp-file-plus-rename commit), just with the transform being a
//! full encoding change instead of a text substitution. Backend for the
//! large-file preview window's encoding-menu "Convert File to Encoding…"
//! entry: a truncated preview only ever has a bounded slice of the file
//! loaded, so the ordinary in-editor "Save with Encoding" (which re-encodes
//! whatever's in memory) cannot be used to change such a file's encoding --
//! see `src/main.ts`'s `showEncodingMenu`.
//!
//! Unlike `stream_replace_in_file` (which reuses one encoding for both
//! decode and encode, and therefore rejects UTF-16 in both directions --
//! see that module's doc comment), this command's source and target
//! encodings are two independent parameters, so the UTF-16 dead end
//! (`Encoding::new_encoder()`'s documented output encoding for UTF-16BE/LE
//! is UTF-8, never a real UTF-16 encoder) only rules out UTF-16 as a
//! *target*. A UTF-16 *source* decodes perfectly well through the ordinary
//! streaming `Decoder` (that side has no such dead end) and is fully
//! supported -- see
//! `utf16le_source_converts_to_utf8_correctly_across_chunk_boundary`.
//!
//! Two-stage lossy gate, mirroring `lib.rs::save_document`'s two-phase gate
//! rather than introducing a separate up-front dry-run command: a single
//! call with `allow_lossy: false` streams the whole file exactly once --
//! decoding, scanning every decoded character's representability in the
//! target encoding (`normalize::UnmappableScanner`, fed one already-decoded
//! chunk at a time so the aggregation never needs the whole file's text in
//! memory at once -- the same sample cap/dedup/position machinery
//! `lossy_save_report` uses, just fed incrementally), and always encoding to
//! a temp file regardless of whether anything unmappable turns up (encoding_rs
//! substitutes a numeric-character-reference fallback for an unmappable
//! character rather than failing -- see `streamcodec::encode_chunk`'s doc
//! comment). If the scan ends with `unmappable_count > 0` and the caller
//! didn't already allow it, the temp file is discarded and the aggregated
//! report comes back with `written: false` -- nothing on disk changes, and
//! no fingerprint re-check is needed since nothing was written. Note this
//! means even a *rejected* dry run briefly needs as much free disk space as
//! the full converted output (the temp file is written in full before the
//! rejection is decided, then deleted) -- same cost `streamreplace.rs`
//! already accepts for every run, just also paid on this command's reject
//! path, not only its commit path. The
//! frontend shows the exact same `showLossySaveConfirm` dialog
//! `save_document`'s own lossy rejection uses (`src/lossysave.ts`, via
//! `src/streamconvert.ts`), since this command's report reuses
//! `normalize::LossySaveReport` verbatim, and only after the user explicitly
//! agrees, re-invokes this command with `allow_lossy: true` -- which
//! re-streams the file from scratch (there is no cheaper way to "resume" a
//! discarded temp file) and commits. This is the "one read per call, two
//! reads only when a lossy retry actually happens" trade the ROADMAP task
//! explicitly accepts as performance-acceptable, the same shape
//! `save_document`'s own two-call gate already has.
//!
//! Line endings are never touched (mirrors `stream_replace_in_file`, which
//! also never normalizes or re-applies a line ending): whatever `\n`,
//! `\r\n`, or lone `\r` sequences the source decodes to are just ordinary
//! characters as far as this module is concerned, encoded straight back out
//! -- there is no `line_ending` parameter here at all, unlike
//! `save_document`/`batch::commit_conversion`.
//!
//! BOM handling: the source and target encodings are independent, so unlike
//! `stream_replace_in_file` (which preserves whatever BOM bytes were
//! already there, since source and target are the same encoding), this
//! command's target BOM is a fresh, explicit decision (`target_with_bom`),
//! completely unrelated to whether the source happened to have one. A
//! source BOM matching `source_encoding` is always stripped by the
//! streaming decoder (`new_decoder_with_bom_removal`, same as
//! `stream_replace_in_file`) so it never leaks into the decoded text or
//! gets double-counted; a target BOM is written up front, before the main
//! loop, only when `target_with_bom` is set *and* `target_encoding` is
//! UTF-8 -- exactly the same `with_bom && encoding == UTF_8` rule
//! `encoding::encode` already applies for the regular (non-streaming) save
//! path, and the same "no BOM control for legacy targets" convention
//! `src/encodings.ts`'s `encodingChoices` already encodes on the frontend
//! (a plain "UTF-8" choice there always carries `withBom: false`, so
//! picking it is how the frontend expresses "no BOM" -- there is no
//! separate default-computation on this side of the IPC boundary).
//!
//! No byte-identical-output short circuit: unlike
//! `batch::commit_conversion`, which holds the whole original file in
//! memory and can cheaply compare it against the freshly encoded bytes
//! before deciding whether to write, this module never holds more than one
//! chunk of either the source or the re-encoded output in memory at once --
//! comparing the two in full would need a second complete read of the
//! original file. Given this command's entire purpose is an actual
//! encoding change (unlike batch conversion's `"keep"` + `"keep"` no-op
//! case), a request whose source and target already match commits a
//! harmless rewrite rather than detecting and skipping it; this is a
//! deliberate scope decision, not an oversight.

/// 3. A target BOM prefix is written up front only when `target_with_bom`

/// 4. The source is streamed, decoded, scanned for target-representability,
///    and re-encoded to a temp file in the same directory
///    (`create_tmp_exclusive`) -- see [`run_convert_loop`]. Any malformed
///    source byte sequence aborts immediately: the temp file is discarded
///    and the original is never touched.
/// 5. If the scan found unmappable characters and `allow_lossy` is false,
///    the temp file is discarded and this returns `Ok` with `written:
///    false` and a populated `lossy_report` -- nothing on disk changes, and
///    (since nothing was written) no fingerprint re-check is needed. The
///    caller re-invokes with `allow_lossy: true` after explicit user
///    confirmation to actually commit the lossy bytes.
/// 6. Before committing, the file at `path` is re-stat'd and compared
///    against the fingerprint captured in step 2: if its size, mtime, or
///    (Unix) inode identity no longer match -- including the file having
///    been deleted outright -- the temp file is discarded and this returns
///    `Err` without ever touching `path`. This narrows (never eliminates)
///    the race between reading and committing, the same discipline
///    `stream_replace_in_file`'s `verify_unchanged` and `save_document`'s
///    `expected_fingerprint` check already apply (issues #94/#102/#113,
///    shared `fsguard.rs`).
/// 7. On success: `sync_all`, the fingerprint check above, carry over the
///    original file's permissions, then `rename` over the target -- the
///    same atomic discipline as `lib.rs::atomic_write` and
