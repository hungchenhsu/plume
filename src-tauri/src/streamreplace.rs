//! Streaming find/replace over an entire file on disk, for the read-only
//! large-file preview window (ARCHITECTURE.md's large-file mode): the
//! in-editor Find/Replace can't be used there because only a bounded
//! slice of the file is ever loaded, and saving that slice back would
//! destroy the rest of the file. This command instead streams the whole
//! file from disk in bounded chunks, decodes, replaces, re-encodes, and
//! writes to a same-directory temp file — atomically renamed over the
//! original only once at least one replacement was made — so memory use
//! stays flat (`O(CHUNK_BYTES)`) regardless of file size, and a crash or
//! error mid-run can never leave a half-written file (Track B,
//! ROADMAP.md).
//!
//! `encoding` is the file's own on-disk encoding (the frontend passes the
//! open document's already-detected `doc.encoding`) — used for both
//! decoding and re-encoding. This command never converts between
//! encodings; see [`stream_replace_in_file`]'s doc comment for the full
//! safety discipline.
//!
//! UTF-16 is deliberately rejected up front (see
//! [`stream_replace_in_file`]): `Encoding::new_encoder()` returns an
//! encoder for the encoding's *output encoding*, and per encoding_rs's own
//! docs, "the output encoding of UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, and replacement is
//! UTF-8" — there is no real UTF-16 encoder. Calling it naively here would
//! silently write UTF-8 bytes into a file labeled UTF-16, corrupting it.
//! `chunk.rs` already excludes UTF-16 from large-file paging for a related
//! reason (line alignment needs code-unit-aware boundaries); this follows
//! the same precedent rather than hand-rolling a manual UTF-16 streaming
//! encoder the way `encoding::encode_utf16` does for the (non-streaming,
//! whole-buffer) save path.
//!
//! Case-insensitive matching (`case_sensitive: false`) is ASCII-only
//! (`[u8]::eq_ignore_ascii_case`): non-ASCII characters always compare
//! exactly, never folded. Full Unicode case folding can change a string's
//! byte length (e.g. German "ß" uppercases to "SS"), which would break
//! this module's byte-offset bookkeeping; restricting folding to ASCII
//! (where upper/lower always occupy exactly one byte each) sidesteps that
//! trap entirely rather than working around it.
//!
//! The per-chunk decode/encode primitives (`decode_chunk`/`encode_chunk`/
//! `read_chunk`/`CHUNK_BYTES`) now live in `streamcodec.rs`, shared with
//! `streamconvert.rs`'s streaming encoding-conversion command (ROADMAP.md
//! v0.4 Track B) — extracted the same way `fsguard.rs` was pulled out of
//! this module for a second caller. Only the search/replace-specific
//! looping and carry semantics (`run_replace_loop`, `replace_pass`) stay
//! here.
//!
//! ## Read-chunk byte-passthrough (issue #96, part 1/3)
//!
//! `encoding_rs`'s decode mapping for several legacy multi-byte encodings
//! (Big5, Shift_JIS and GBK among them) is not injective — more than one
//! on-disk byte sequence can decode to the same character, while `encode`
//! always emits only that character's single canonical byte sequence (see
//! `encoding.rs`'s round-trip contract doc comment). A naive whole-file
//! decode -> replace -> re-encode therefore risks silently canonicalizing
//! bytes the user never asked to touch, anywhere in the file, even when
//! the actual search matched only once. `run_replace_loop` narrows that
//! blast radius to read-chunk granularity: it copies a chunk's *raw*
//! bytes straight to the output — bypassing re-encoding, and therefore
//! bypassing any canonicalization, entirely — whenever the encoding is
//! stateless (ISO-2022-JP is excluded outright — see below) and all of
//! the following hold for that chunk:
//!
//! 1. **No match involvement**: the chunk's work buffer (this round's
//!    decoded text, plus anything carried in from the previous round)
//!    contains zero matches, and `replace_pass` leaves nothing unresolved
//!    to carry into the next round.
//! 2. **No carry-in**: the previous round didn't carry any unresolved
//!    match-candidate text into this round's work buffer.
//! 3. **No decoder pending on either edge**: this round's decode didn't
//!    consume any bytes the streaming `Decoder` had buffered internally
//!    from the *previous* chunk (entry pending), and this round's decode
//!    didn't itself leave an incomplete trailing character buffered for
//!    the *next* chunk (exit pending). Both directions matter — either
//!    one means this round's raw bytes alone no longer correspond 1:1 to
//!    this round's decoded text, so writing them verbatim would drop or
//!    duplicate bytes relative to the neighboring chunk.
//!
//! `encoding_rs`'s `Decoder` doesn't expose its internal pending-bytes
//! state directly, so condition 3 is checked with a self-sufficiency
//! probe (`chunk_is_decode_self_sufficient`) instead: decode this round's
//! raw bytes alone, from scratch, forced to finalize (`last: true`), and
//! require the result to match this round's real (streaming) decoded text
//! exactly, with no malformed sequences either. See that function's doc
//! comment for why this is a conservative (never-*unsafe*, only
//! potentially over-cautious) proxy. It costs one extra decode per chunk,
//! so — per its call site in `run_replace_loop` — it only ever runs after
//! the cheap conditions 1 and 2 already hold.
//!
//! Chunk 0 is unconditionally excluded from passthrough whenever a BOM
//! was written (`bom_len > 0`): `run_replace_loop` re-reads the file from
//! offset 0, so chunk 0's raw bytes still physically contain the BOM that
//! `stream_replace_in_file` already wrote once, verbatim, before the loop
//! started (see that function's own BOM doc comment) — passing chunk 0's
//! raw bytes through as well would duplicate it.
//!
//! **Stateful encodings are excluded from passthrough entirely.**
//! ISO-2022-JP — the one encoding in encoding_rs whose *encoder* carries
//! state across calls (a shift-mode flag deciding whether the next call
//! needs an escape sequence) — is reachable here via `encoding.rs`'s
//! chardetng auto-detection even though the frontend's own encoding
//! picker never offers it, and it always takes the full re-encode path.
//! The reason is subtle enough to spell out: conditions 1–3 above are
//! *text-level and decoder-level* guarantees, and even keeping the
//! shared encoder running every round (see the next paragraph) cannot
//! make passthrough safe for it. A passed-through chunk's raw bytes
//! carry their own trailing shift state, while the shared encoder's
//! state after encoding that same chunk's *text* is whatever its own
//! (discarded) output ended in — and the two can diverge: e.g. a raw
//! tail of `ESC(J` + letters ends the *file* in Roman mode, while the
//! decoded text (plain letters) leaves the *encoder* in ASCII mode. The
//! next chunk to be re-encoded then splices encoder-mode bytes onto a
//! file that is in a different mode, and the result can decode cleanly
//! into silently different text (an ASCII-mode `0x5C` backslash read in
//! Roman mode is "¥") — worse than the canonicalization this feature
//! exists to avoid. Re-encode output, by contrast, is shift-state
//! self-consistent end to end, so ISO-2022-JP simply keeps the exact
//! pre-passthrough behavior. See
//! `iso_2022_jp_is_excluded_from_passthrough_keeping_content_correct`,
//! the red-to-green regression built on exactly that construction.
//!
//! Every chunk is still *decoded* and *encoded* exactly as before,
//! regardless of the passthrough decision — only which byte buffer
//! actually gets written to `tmp` differs, and the encoder's return value
//! is still checked for `had_unmappable` every round. For the stateless
//! encodings passthrough actually applies to, the encoder state argument
//! is moot by definition; keeping the encode call unconditional anyway
//! preserves the unmappable-abort safety net's every-round coverage and
//! keeps the loop's shape identical on both paths.
//!
//! Scope, deliberately: this is chunk-granularity preservation, not
//! match-granularity. A chunk that contains an actual match is still
//! re-encoded in full, including any non-injective byte pair elsewhere in
//! that *same* chunk (see
//! `matching_chunk_still_canonicalizes_non_injective_pair_in_same_chunk`).
//! Narrowing further — so only the matched span itself is ever re-encoded
//! and every other byte in a matching chunk is preserved too — is left
//! for future work; issue #96 tracks it. `StreamReplaceReport`'s
//! `unmatched_region_reencoded` flag discloses whether a run swept any
//! zero-match chunk into re-encoding anyway (carry/pending-entangled with
//! a neighboring match, or chunk 0 excluded under a BOM) — a coarse,
//! honest signal reserved for a future informed-consent UI (issue #96
//! parts 2/3); no frontend reads it yet.

///   escapes both the prefix search and the carry. See
///   `match_fully_inside_chunk_near_seam_is_found`, the regression lock
///   from the adversarial review that caught exactly that.)
/// - In a final pass (`is_final: true`), no more input is coming, so an
///   unfittable window can never complete: the candidate and everything
///   after it are literal text, and `carry_from` is `text.len()`.
///
/// `carry_from` is bounded: an unresolvable candidate sits within the

/// string, not the chunk. (A search string longer than a whole chunk
/// degrades gracefully: the carry accumulates until a full window has
/// arrived, trading the flat-memory bound for correctness in a case no
/// interactive user hits.)
///
/// The byte-window scan (rather than a char-by-char one) is safe because
/// `search` is itself valid UTF-8: its first byte is never a UTF-8
/// continuation byte (0x80-0xBF), and `eq_ignore_ascii_case` only ever
/// folds ASCII bytes into other ASCII bytes (never into — or out of — a

/// `carry_from` lands on one — and a full window match, by the same
/// argument applied to every byte in it, ends on one too. The loop below
/// never slices `text` mid-character.

///   bullet above) — so the pending bytes it drops from *its* own
///   decoded text are never separately written by K-1 either, since K-1's
///   own passthrough eligibility is decided the same way. The one thing
///   that would make this genuinely unsafe — chunk K-1 believing it

///
/// 1. `search` must be non-empty and `encoding` must name a known,
///    non-UTF-16 encoding (see the module doc comment for why UTF-16 is
///    rejected) — checked before anything is read from disk.
/// 2. `replace` is encode-checked in isolation first: if it contains a
///    character `encoding` can't represent, this returns `Err` and never
///    touches the file — a replacement can never partially land.
/// 3. `search` is also encode-checked: if `encoding` can't represent it,
///    no sequence of bytes that round-trips through `encoding` (which is
///    what every byte of this file does, having already been saved in it)
///    can ever decode to text containing `search` — so this returns `Ok`
///    with zero replacements without reading the file at all, rather than
///    erroring.
/// 4. The source is streamed and decoded; any malformed byte sequence
///    aborts immediately (temp file discarded, original untouched) rather
///    than writing back a partially-repaired file — matching
///    ARCHITECTURE.md's "decode errors are surfaced, never silently
///    rendered as if the text were fine".
/// 5. Re-encoding is defensively checked too: `replace` was already
///    validated in step 2, and every unreplaced *character* came from
///    decoding this file's own bytes in `encoding`, so it is by
///    construction representable in `encoding` again — this check exists
///    for defense in depth, not because failure is expected. Any
///    unmappable output still aborts rather than ever writing a lossy
///    byte the caller didn't explicitly agree to (mirrors
///    `save_document`'s `allow_lossy` gate in `lib.rs`, just with no lossy
///    path offered here at all). Representable is not the same as
///    byte-identical, though: several legacy encodings (Big5, Shift_JIS
///    and GBK among them — see `encoding::encode`'s round-trip contract
///    note and issue #96 for the full analysis) are not injective, so an
///    unreplaced byte sequence can still come back out re-encoded to a
///    different, canonical byte sequence for the same character *within a
///    chunk that itself contains a match* — see
///    `matching_chunk_still_canonicalizes_non_injective_pair_in_same_chunk`.
///    A chunk with no match involvement at all is instead copied through
///    byte-for-byte untouched — see the module doc comment's three
///    passthrough conditions and `StreamReplaceReport::unmatched_region_reencoded`.
/// 6. Before that commit, the file at `path` is re-stat'd and compared
///    against the [`Fingerprint`] captured right after the source was
///    opened: if its size, mtime, or (Unix) inode identity no longer
///    match — including the file having been deleted outright — the temp
///    file is discarded and this returns `Err` without ever touching
///    `path`. This is what stops an external process that atomically
///    replaces the same path while a multi-GB stream is still in flight
///    (log rotation, a formatter, a sync tool) from having its newer
///    content silently overwritten once this command finally finishes
///    reading the now-stale open handle (issue #94). This narrows the race
///    to the microsecond-scale check-to-rename window rather than
///    eliminating it — no portable rename has an identity-conditional
///    variant — but that is a vast improvement over leaving the whole
///    multi-minute stream unguarded. See [`capture_fingerprint`] /
///    [`verify_unchanged`].
/// 7. Zero matches leaves the file completely untouched — no temp file
///    persists, no rename, `mtime` unchanged. Only a run with at least one
///    replacement commits: `sync_all`, the fingerprint check above, carry
///    over the original file's permissions, then `rename` over the
///    target — the same atomic discipline as `lib.rs::atomic_write`, just
///    fed by a temp file filled incrementally instead of from one
///    in-memory buffer.
///
/// BOM handling: up to 3 bytes (the longest BOM any encoding here uses —
/// UTF-8's `EF BB BF`) are peeked from the source first. If they form a
/// BOM for `enc` specifically, those exact bytes are written verbatim as
/// the first bytes of the temp file, and the streaming decoder — always
/// constructed in BOM-*removal* mode regardless of whether a BOM was
/// actually found — strips them back out of the decoded text it produces
/// from the start of the stream, so the search/replace pass never sees
/// them. This mirrors `encoding::decode_with`'s `had_bom` computation
/// (BOM must match the *specific* requested encoding, not just look like
/// some BOM) applied at streaming granularity instead of to a whole
