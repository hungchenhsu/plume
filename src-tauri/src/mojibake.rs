//! Mojibake repair: detect "bytes decoded with the wrong encoding, then
//! saved back to disk" round-trips and offer a previewed, reversible fix.
//!
//! The shape of the bug this repairs: a file's *real* bytes were originally
//! `original`-encoded text. Something (an editor, a script, a browser)
//! opened those bytes using the wrong encoding, `intermediate`, producing
//! garbled but still-valid-looking text -- mojibake -- and that garbled
//! text got saved, so the bytes on disk now really are `intermediate`'s
//! encoding of the mojibake. To undo it: take the mojibake text the user
//! sees and *encode* it with `intermediate` (this losslessly reconstructs
//! the original bytes, because that is exactly the byte sequence
//! `intermediate` decoded to produce this text in the first place), then
//! *decode* those bytes with `original` (the encoding they actually were
//! all along). Example: Big5 bytes opened as Windows-1252 and re-saved --
//! encoding the garbled text back to Windows-1252 recovers the original
//! Big5 bytes, and decoding those as Big5 recovers the real text.
//!
//! This module never touches disk and never emits a raw byte over IPC
//! (ARCHITECTURE.md's hard constraints): it operates purely on the
//! in-memory document string the frontend already holds, and always
//! returns decoded `String`s. The repaired text becomes an unsaved editor
//! change (undoable, not auto-saved) -- reversibility is the caller's
//! responsibility, this module only ever computes the candidate/result.

///    Windows defaulted to windows-1251.
///

///
/// `(WINDOWS_1251, KOI8_R)` -- the reverse of the pair below, i.e. genuine

/// 0.1.17 has no KOI8-R candidate in its detection model at all, only
/// KOI8-U (its README's "Notes About Encodings" lists "KOI8-R: Detected as

/// among them; `src/encodings.ts`'s `MANUAL_ONLY_ENCODINGS` documents the
/// identical fact for this app's own open-file auto-detect). Gate (c)
/// below requires chardetng's cold guess on the recovered bytes to equal
/// `original`; when `original` is `KOI8_R` that comparison can *never*

/// doesn't trigger either (`no_candidates_for_normal_korean_excludes_

///
/// `(WINDOWS_1250, UTF_8)` -- Central European UTF-8 mis-decoded as
