//! Deterministic-PRNG fuzz expansion for the encoding round-trip contract
//! (ROADMAP v0.4 Track D), scheduled before the Track A content-transform
//! work (full-width/half-width, normalization) lands on top of the
//! encoding layer.
//!
//! ## Survey before writing this
//!
//! The task brief that scheduled this expected `streamreplace.rs` to
//! already have a fuzz precedent (a "2M fuzz" using a hand-rolled
//! xorshift/LCG PRNG) to reuse. It does not: `streamreplace.rs`'s large
//! tests (`replaces_across_whole_large_utf8_file`,
//! `replaces_in_big5_file_preserving_encoding`) are fixed-size,
//! non-randomized stress fixtures (an 11 MiB planted-marker file, a
//! `filler_unit.repeat(5_600_000)` Big5 buffer) -- large, but
//! deterministic in the ordinary sense of "no randomness involved", not
//! PRNG-driven. A repo-wide search for `fuzz`/`xorshift`/`lcg`/`prng`/
//! `rand` across `src-tauri/src` and `src` turned up nothing. This file is
//! therefore the first randomized fuzz harness in the crate; `XorShift64`
//! below was picked fresh (see its doc comment) rather than reused from
//! anywhere.
//!
//! `encoding.rs` had exactly two tests literally named `round_trips_*`
//! (`round_trips_big5`, `round_trips_utf16le_with_bom`, plus
//! `round_trips_big5_via_extension_preference`, which exercises the same
//! Big5 case through a different entry point) before this file: Big5 and
//! UTF-16LE, both single fixed short strings ("中文" / "hi"). No encoding
//! round-trip test existed at all for plain UTF-8, UTF-16BE, GBK,
//! gb18030, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, or windows-1252 -- this file adds
//! deterministic-PRNG coverage across all ten.
//!
//! **v0.5 Track E1 update**: `src/encodings.ts`'s curated picker grew from
//! 11 to 27 entries (windows-125x family, four ISO-8859 members, KOI8-R/U,
//! windows-874, macintosh -- sixteen more single-byte encodings), and this
//! file's per-encoding round-trip coverage (fuzz test + pool sanity test)
//! grew with it, following the exact same "per-encoding round-trip test
//! lives here, not in `encoding.rs`" precedent this file established. See
//! `ALL_ENCODING_LABELS` below, which is now the Rust-side mirror of the
//! full 26-distinct-value picker list (27 minus the UTF-8/UTF-8-BOM
//! duplicate), and the "v0.5 Track E1" pool section further down.
//!
//! ## What this fuzzes (and what it deliberately does not)
//!
//! Issue #109 (see `encoding.rs`'s module doc, "Round-trip contract")
//! documents precisely what this project promises on a decode -> encode
//! cycle: the decoded *text*, the *encoding label*, the *BOM flag*, and
//! the *line ending* survive; **byte-for-byte identity of the re-encoded
//! output is not guaranteed** for a handful of non-injective legacy
//! multi-byte mappings (three are pinned as characterization tests at the
//! bottom of `encoding.rs`). This file fuzzes exactly the guaranteed
//! layer -- `text -> apply_line_ending -> encode -> decode -> normalize_to_lf
//! -> text` -- the same pipeline `save_document`/`open_document` run, and
//! never asserts anything about the intermediate bytes beyond "encode
//! reported nothing unmappable" / "decode reported nothing malformed". It
//! is not a byte-level fuzz and is not expected to (and must not) trip the
//! #109 gap: that gap only bites when the *input bytes* are already a
//! non-canonical legacy sequence, and every byte sequence here is
//! `encoding_rs`-emitted, which is always canonical by construction.
//!
//! ## Representable-text pools
//!
//! Two families:
//!
//! - **Universal** (UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE): every non-surrogate
//!   Unicode scalar value is representable, so generation samples the
//!   full scalar range directly (`random_universal_scalar`) plus a
//!   curated edge-case set (`universal_edge_scalars`: C0/C1 controls,
//!   NUL, DEL, U+FEFF, U+FFFD, and a spread of astral-plane characters
//!   that force UTF-16 surrogate pairs) mixed in at a fixed rate -- no
//!   encode-filter needed, since `encoding_rs` treats UTF-8/UTF-16 as
//!   total, injective transformation formats over that domain.
//! - **Filtered** (Big5, GBK, gb18030, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, EUC-KR,
//!   windows-1252): a plausible candidate Unicode range for that script
//!   (e.g. CJK Unified Ideographs for the Chinese/Japanese legacy
//!   encodings, Hangul syllables for EUC-KR) is swept and filtered down
//!   to only the characters `encoding::encode` reports as mappable --
//!   the "encode-filter" method the task brief explicitly allows, so this
//!   file never has to hand-transcribe any encoding's mapping table.
//!   Critically, the encode-filter result is *not* trusted on its own:
//!   every pool has a dedicated sanity test (`*_pool_is_representable`)
//!   that independently proves `decode(encode(c)) == c` for every pooled
//!   character, one at a time -- the oracle the task brief requires to
//!   hold independently of the filter that built the pool.
//!
//! ## Mojibake wizard reversibility
//!
//! `mojibake::REPAIR_PAIRS` (made `pub(crate)` for this file to iterate
//! without duplicating it) lists the wizard's nine supported
//! `(intermediate, original)` mis-decode hypotheses. For each, this file
//! generates representable `original`-text, encodes it (the bytes a real
//! file would have had), mis-decodes those bytes with `intermediate`
//! (skipping -- not failing -- the rare random sample that doesn't decode
//! cleanly under `intermediate`, exactly as real mojibake requires a
//! clean mis-decode to occur at all), and asserts
//! `apply_mojibake_repair` recovers the original text exactly.
