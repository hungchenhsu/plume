//! Batch encoding *and* line-ending conversion: scan a folder for a
//! dry-run report, then convert selected files to a target
//! encoding/line-ending, one atomic write per file. Track A of the v0.3
//! roadmap (ROADMAP.md).
//!
//! Two independent axes, each accepting a "keep" sentinel meaning "don't
//! touch this axis":
//!
//! - `target_encoding`: a canonical `encoding_rs` name, or the literal
//!   string `"keep"` — re-encode each file with its own detected encoding
//!   and detected BOM state (ignoring `target_with_bom`) instead of a
//!   caller-chosen target. This is what makes an encoding-preserving,
//!   line-ending-only conversion possible.
//! - `line_ending`: `"LF"`, `"CRLF"`, or `"keep"` — leave every line
//!   ending exactly as found on disk.
//!
//! `"keep"` + `"keep"` classifies every file `alreadyTarget` (nothing on
//! either axis is *asked* to change). Converting such a file is usually a
//! no-op: `convert_one`'s byte-identical skip (`out_bytes == bytes`)
//! detects when re-encoding reproduced the file's own bytes exactly and
//! leaves it untouched. That skip is a detection, not a guarantee, though
//! — for the legacy non-injective encodings documented on
//! `encoding::encode` (Big5, Shift_JIS, GBK; see issue #96), a file that
//! already contains non-canonical bytes fails that identity check and
//! gets silently rewritten with canonicalized bytes even under
//! `"keep"` + `"keep"`. Issue #96 (3/3) closes the "nothing in the report
//! distinguishing that from a real conversion" half of this: every
//! `alreadyTarget` `BatchEntry` now carries a `byte_drift` flag, computed by
//! rebuilding the same pipeline `convert_one` would run (`rebuild_output_bytes`,
//! shared by both) against the scan's own decoded bytes and comparing to the
//! original — see `BatchEntry::byte_drift`'s doc comment for the exact
//! no-op/skip rules. This is scan-time visibility only; `convert_one`'s own
//! behavior (silently canonicalize, still succeed) is unchanged.
//!
//! Issue #96 (3/3) only covered the `alreadyTarget` (both axes untouched)
//! half of this risk, though — issue #176 closes the other half it left
//! documented but unimplemented: a `convertible` file whose *encoding*
//! axis is untouched but whose *line-ending* axis was asked to change
//! (`target_encoding: "keep"`, or an explicit target equal to the file's
//! own encoding, with `line_ending` set to something the file isn't
//! already) still re-encodes that file, and re-encoding is exactly what
//! silently canonicalizes non-canonical legacy bytes — a user who asked
//! only "unify my line endings" gets an uninvited encoding
//! canonicalization bundled in, with nothing in the report distinguishing
//! it from the line-ending change they actually asked for. `byte_drift`
//! now covers both cases; see `BatchEntry::byte_drift`'s doc comment.
//!
//! Folder walking mirrors `search.rs`'s find-in-files traversal (same
//! `SKIP_DIRS`, same dotdir/symlink skip rules) so batch conversion never
//! descends into VCS metadata or dependency trees either.
//!
//! Data-integrity invariant this module exists to protect (see
//! `convert_one`): a converted file's *line endings* are never touched
//! unless `line_ending` explicitly asks for it. Classification and
//! conversion both work on the raw decode of a file's own bytes — never
//! run through `encoding::normalize_to_lf` the way `lib.rs::open_document`
//! normalizes for the editor buffer — *unless* `line_ending != "keep"`, in
//! which case `convert_one` normalizes to LF and re-applies the requested
//! ending before re-encoding. With `line_ending: "keep"`, a CRLF file
//! stays CRLF and an LF file stays LF; only the byte-level encoding is
//! meant to change (or nothing at all, with `target_encoding: "keep"` too
//! — modulo the non-canonical-byte caveat above).
//!
//! Deviation from the original task sketch: `scan_batch_conversion` takes
//! an explicit `target_with_bom: bool` parameter (mirroring
//! `execute_batch_conversion`'s existing one), even though the initial
//! signature sketch omitted it. The spec's own classification rule —
//! "already target: encoding name *and* BOM state both match" — cannot be
//! implemented without knowing the target's desired BOM state, so this is
//! treated as a required correction rather than a deviation to avoid.
//! `target_with_bom` is meaningless (and ignored) whenever
//! `target_encoding == "keep"`.

    // change (the branch above already returned when both axes agreed) —
    // a pure "keep the encoding, just unify line endings" request. That
    // still re-encodes the file, and re-encoding is exactly what
    // silently canonicalizes a non-injective legacy byte sequence (Big5,
    // Shift_JIS, GBK) — the same risk the `alreadyTarget` branch's
    // `byte_drift` above exists to surface, just reached from the other
    // side of the line-ending axis. `encoding_axis_unchanged` also proves
    // `status` above can only be `STATUS_CONVERTIBLE` here (re-encoding
    // into the exact encoding the content was just decoded from cannot be
    // lossy — see the doc comment right above `status`), so this never
    // races the lossy branch.
    //
    // Isolating the line-ending change from the drift verdict is the
    // whole trick: rebuild with `target`/`target_with_bom` (the requested,
    // encoding-axis-unchanged target) but `line_ending: "keep"` instead of
    // `target_line_ending` — `rebuild_output_bytes`'s "keep" path hands
    // `decoded.content` through completely untouched, bypassing
    // `normalize_to_lf`/`apply_line_ending` entirely rather than relying
    // on them round-tripping a pure style back to itself. Any mismatch
    // against the original `bytes` that remains after subtracting the
    // requested line-ending change out this way can only come from the
    // encoding step — precisely `bytedrift.rs`'s R1b question ("would an
    // encoding-preserving re-save reproduce these bytes?") asked here at
    // scan time instead of at save time.
    //
    // Skipped (stays `false`) for a Mixed on-disk line ending, same
    // precedent as the `alreadyTarget` branch's own skip: a Mixed file is
    // what pushed this file into `convertible` in the first place (it can
    // never equal a concrete "LF"/"CRLF" target), but a drift verdict
    // still isn't meaningful for it — not because the rebuild can't
    // reproduce it (the "keep" path above hands any content through
    // as-is, mixed or not) but to stay consistent with every other
    // byte_drift skip rule rather than carve out a special case that
    // treats Mixed differently here than everywhere else.
    //
    // Deliberately narrower than "any convertible entry": `false` whenever
    // `encoding_axis_unchanged` is false, i.e. whenever this file is
    // `convertible`/`lossy` because the *encoding* axis changed (or both
