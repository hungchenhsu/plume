/// fingerprint check (issue #94, shared here via `fsguard.rs`). When
/// `expected_fingerprint` is `Some` and `force` is `false`, `path` is
/// re-fingerprinted right before the write and compared; a mismatch aborts
/// with `stale: true, written: false` and touches nothing on disk. `force:
/// true` skips the check entirely — the retry path after the user
/// explicitly chooses to overwrite. `expected_fingerprint: None` also skips
/// the check: there is no prior on-disk baseline to compare against for an
/// untitled document's first save or a Save As to a brand-new path. On a
/// successful write, the fresh post-write fingerprint is returned so the
/// caller can use it as the baseline for the *next* save.
///
/// Like the streaming-replace guard this shares `fsguard.rs` with (#102),
