//! Find/replace across every file in a folder (ROADMAP.md v0.5 Track S),
//! built as a dry-run scan + selective execute two-phase flow: the frontend
//! calls [`scan_replace_in_folder`] first (nothing on disk changes), the
//! user checks off which reported files to touch, then
//! [`execute_replace_in_folder`] rewrites only that subset.
//!
//! Search semantics mirror `search.rs`: a match never spans two lines,
//! `use_regex: false` treats `query` as a literal substring, and
//! `case_sensitive: false` folds case (Unicode-aware, matching
//! `regex::RegexBuilder::case_insensitive`, exactly as `search.rs`'s own
//! `Matcher` already does). **v1 scope, by design**: `replacement` is
//! always inserted as a literal string, even in regex mode — a literal
//! `"$1"` in `replacement` is never expanded to a captured group. Every
//! match (scan's count, execute's replacement) is produced by the same
//! [`build_matcher`] + `regex::Regex::find_iter`/`replace_all(...,
//! regex::NoExpand(replacement))` pair, so scan and execute can never
//! silently disagree about what counts as a match.
//!
//! One line-splitting rule is shared by *every* encoding, matched or not:
//! lines are found with `linebreak::scan_line_breaks` (LF, CRLF, or lone
//! CR — the same three-way split `lineindex.rs`/`chunk.rs` use, not Rust's
//! `str::lines()`, which does not recognize a lone CR as a terminator at
//! all). Using the shared byte-level splitter — rather than
//! `search.rs`-style `.lines()` — for scan's own match counting, not only
//! execute's rewrite, is a deliberate correctness choice beyond a literal
//! reading of "follow search.rs's line scan": it guarantees a dry-run's
//! `matchCount` can never disagree with what execute actually replaces on
//! a Classic-Mac (lone-CR) file. See this module's own tests for the
//! agreement lock.
//!
//! ## Encoding-dependent rewrite strategy
//!
//! [`execute_replace_in_folder`] forks on `encoding.is_ascii_compatible()`
//! (`encoding_rs`'s own predicate — see its source: `true` for everything
//! except UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, ISO-2022-JP, and the never-auto-detected
//! `replacement` encoding). This is the exact encoding set
//! `linebreak.rs`'s module doc already assumes ("a literal 0x0A/0x0D byte
//! can never appear as part of a multi-byte sequence") — binding the
//! routing decision to the crate's own predicate, rather than a
//! hand-maintained list, means the two can never drift apart; this
//! module's own `ascii_compatible_encodings_never_place_0x0a_0x0d_inside_a_multibyte_sequence`
//! test empirically locks the predicate against that invariant for every
//! encoding `encoding_rs` ships.
//!
//! - **ASCII-compatible ([`line_level_replace`])**: raw file bytes are
//!   split into line segments; a segment with no match is copied to the
//!   output *byte-for-byte, terminator included, without ever being
//!   decoded* — so a non-canonical-but-valid legacy byte sequence on an
//!   untouched line (e.g. Big5's duplicate mapping `8E 69` for "箸", which
//!   `encoding::encode` would otherwise canonicalize to `BA E6` — see
//!   `encoding.rs`'s "Round-trip contract" doc and issue #96) survives
//!   completely untouched. Only a matched segment's *content* bytes are
//!   decoded, replaced, and re-encoded; its terminator bytes are still
//!   copied verbatim, never touched.
//! - **Fallback, whole-file re-encode ([`whole_file_replace`])**: for the
//!   two excluded families, for two different reasons:
//!   - **UTF-16LE/BE**: `0x0A`/`0x0D` can legally appear as half of an
//!     unrelated code unit, so byte-level line splitting on the *raw*
//!     bytes is unsound (this is the same reason `chunk.rs` rejects UTF-16
//!     paging). The encoding's mapping is 1:1 (no issue #96 canonicalizing
//!     drift), so a whole-file decode -> replace -> encode loses nothing a
//!     line-level pass would have preserved.
//!   - **ISO-2022-JP**: the one *stateful* encoder/decoder in
//!     `encoding_rs` (shift-mode escape sequences) — reachable here via
//!     chardetng auto-detection even though the encoding picker never
//!     offers it manually. Its shift state is **not** reset at a line
//!     terminator (confirmed against `encoding_rs`'s own decoder: in
//!     `Roman` state, byte `0x0A` still takes the plain
//!     `destination_handle.write_ascii` branch, leaving `decoder_state`
//!     unchanged) — so decoding a later line's raw bytes in isolation, as
//!     if it started fresh in ASCII state, can silently reinterpret a
//!     content byte (e.g. `0x5C`, "\\" in ASCII/JIS mode but "¥" in Roman
//!     mode). This is exactly the R1a lesson recorded in
//!     `.claude/judgment-overlay.md` §4 (`streamreplace.rs`'s chunk
//!     passthrough hazard) applied to line granularity instead of chunk
//!     granularity: re-encoding the *whole* decoded text in one pass is
//!     shift-state self-consistent end to end, so the fallback is safe by
//!     construction, with no special-casing beyond the routing predicate
//!     above (which is `encoding_rs`'s own realization of the same
//!     `enc == ISO_2022_JP` singleton-identity check `streamreplace.rs`
//!     uses explicitly).
//!
//!   Both reconstruct line-by-line (via the same `split_line_segments` +
//!   `split_terminator` helpers `line_level_replace` uses, applied to the
//!   already-decoded UTF-8 text instead of the file's raw bytes — always
//!   safe, since decoded text is UTF-8, itself trivially ASCII-compatible)
//!   so a Mixed on-disk line-ending style still keeps each line's own
//!   terminator character even though, unlike the line-level path, every
//!   line here is re-encoded regardless of match status.
//!
//! [`scan_one_file`]'s counting and lossy-prediction logic is
//! encoding-route-*independent*: it always works from the fully decoded
//! text (`encoding::decode_auto_with_extension` — issue #178: honoring the
//! same per-extension preference `open_document` does, looked up per file
//! from the table via `prefs::extension_encoding_for` since one scan call
//! can walk files of many different extensions), never raw bytes, because
//! a dry run writes nothing and has no byte-preservation obligation to
//! honor.
//!
//! ## Trust mechanisms (this is the highest-risk domain in the app: a
//! folder-wide destructive rewrite over user files)
//!
//! - **Per-file fsguard fingerprint, single handle** ([`fsguard`]):
//!   [`execute_one`] opens each target once and captures its
//!   [`Fingerprint`] from that same handle's metadata before reading any
//!   content (issue #117's TOCTOU-avoidance pattern — the size cap and the
//!   fingerprint always describe the exact bytes about to be read).
//! - **Dry-run -> execute continuity**: [`ReplaceScanEntry::fingerprint`]
//!   (captured at scan time) is round-tripped by the frontend and sent
//!   back as [`ReplaceExecuteTarget::expected_fingerprint`]. `execute_one`
//!   compares its own freshly-opened fingerprint against that baseline
//!   *before* doing any decode/replace work — a mismatch reports
//!   `changed_since_scan` and touches nothing (mirrors issue #113's
//!   `open_document` -> `save_document` `expected_fingerprint` contract,
//!   just with `scan_replace_in_folder` standing in for `open_document`).
//! - **Re-verify immediately before the commit** (issue #114's
//!   `commit_conversion` pattern): right before `atomic_write`, the same
//!   fingerprint captured at open time is re-checked against a *fresh*
//!   stat of the path — catching a change that happened *during* this
//!   call's own decode/replace work, a narrower and later window than the
//!   scan-to-execute check above. One file failing either check never
//!   blocks the rest of the batch; each gets its own
//!   [`ReplaceExecuteEntry`].
//! - **Atomic commit**: `crate::atomic_write` (temp file + rename), shared
//!   with every other write path in this app.
//! - **Lossy two-phase gate**: since only `replacement`'s own characters
//!   can newly become unmappable (everything else in a line already
//!   round-tripped through this file's own encoding once via decode), scan
//!   predicts loss cheaply by probing `replacement` alone
//!   (`encoding::encode`'s own `unmappable` flag — the same probing
//!   primitive `normalize::UnmappableScanner` is built on, just without
//!   its position-tracking, which a per-file boolean has no use for).
//!   Execute never trusts that prediction: it always builds the real
//!   output bytes first and gates on the `unmappable` flag those *actual*
//!   encode calls report, exactly like `save_document`/`commit_conversion`
//!   already do. `allow_lossy: false` (the first call) leaves the file
//!   completely untouched on a lossy verdict; `allow_lossy: true` (after
//!   explicit user confirmation) writes it.
//! - **Malformed files never get written to**: a file whose bytes don't
//!   decode cleanly (`decoded.malformed`) is reported `skipped_reason` at
//!   scan time and `decode_error` at execute time — matching
//!   ARCHITECTURE.md's hard constraint that a decode error must surface to
//!   the user, never be silently treated as fine.
//! - **5 MiB cap**: matches `search.rs::MAX_FILE_SIZE`. Unlike
//!   `search.rs::collect_files`, which silently drops an oversized file
//!   from its walk, [`collect_files`] here is a twin implementation (same
//!   `SKIP_DIRS`/dotdir/symlink rules, reusing `search::ScanError` as-is)
//!   that does *not* filter by size at walk time — this module's own size
//!   check happens per file, after opening, specifically so an oversized
//!   file can be *reported* `skipped_reason` rather than silently vanish
//!   from consideration (this module's requirement goes beyond
//!   `search.rs`'s own, so the walk can't be reused unmodified — same
//!   "twin, not shared" precedent `batch.rs::collect_files` already
//!   established for its own, differently-shaped needs).
