//! Backing data for the read-only Document Info dialog (File menu;
//! ROADMAP.md v0.6 E1) — a "file trust surface" that gathers facts the app
//! already knows or can cheaply re-derive about the active document into
//! one place: on-disk size/mtime here, plus line-ending distribution here
//! too; encoding + detection evidence reuses `explain_detection`'s own
//! building blocks (lib.rs); line/word/char counts reuse the frontend's own
//! `textStatsOf` and never cross IPC at all.
//!
//! Every field this module returns is a *fresh* read off disk, never a
//! frontend-cached value — the same "always re-verify" precedent
//! `explain_detection` itself already set. The dialog takes one snapshot
//! when it opens and does not live-refresh if the file changes underneath
//! it; closing and reopening it re-snapshots (issue #201's sibling
//! commands make the identical trade-off).
//!
//! [`document_info_snapshot`] is the dialog's actual entry point (issue
//! #254): one `File::open` and one `file.metadata()` call derive all three
//! sections at once, so they can never describe three different states of
//! a file that changes underneath the dialog while it loads. The three
//! original single-purpose commands below — [`document_metadata`],
//! [`line_ending_distribution`], and `explain_detection` (lib.rs) — stay
//! exported for their own sake: `explain_detection` is still used
//! independently by `detectcard.ts`'s "Why {encoding}?" popup, and
//! `document_metadata`/`line_ending_distribution` are kept rather than
//! deleted to keep this change's blast radius small, even though the
//! frontend's Document Info dialog no longer calls them directly (grepped:
//! no other TS caller either, as of this change). All three now share their
//! core logic with `document_info_snapshot` (`tally_line_endings`,
//! `read_explain_sample`/`build_detection_explanation` in lib.rs) instead
//! of carrying independent copies.
