//! One-time migration of the app's config directory from the old
//! `app.plume.editor` bundle identifier to the new `app.mojidori.editor`
//! one. When the identifier changes, Tauri resolves `app_config_dir()` to
//! a brand-new, empty path — without this module a user upgrading past
//! the rename would find their preferences, session (including hot-exit
//! backups), and recent-files list apparently gone.
//!
//! `app_config_dir()` is written to by: `store.rs` (preferences.json,
//! session.json, recent.json — see `config_path` there), `backup.rs`
//! (`app_config_dir()/backups`), **`tauri-plugin-window-state`**
//! (`.window-state.json`, written on every exit — this is not our code,
//! but it matters a great deal here: see the state-machine note below),
//! and this module itself (the `.partial` staging dir, the `.migrated`
//! retirement dir, and the `.migration-complete` marker file, all
//! siblings of `app_config_dir()` rather than inside it). Nothing in this
//! codebase or its plugins calls `app_data_dir()`, `app_local_data_dir()`,
//! or `app_cache_dir()`. (On macOS and Windows — this project's two Tier 1
//! platforms — `app_config_dir()` and `app_data_dir()` also happen to
//! resolve to the same path, since both are
//! `dirs::config_dir()`/`dirs::data_dir()` joined with the identifier and
//! those two base dirs coincide on those platforms; that coincidence
//! isn't relied on here, since only `app_config_dir()` is ever used to
//! persist anything.)
//!
//! ## Why a durable completion marker, not just "is `new_dir` non-empty"
//!
//! An earlier version of this module used "does `new_dir` already have
//! content" as the sole signal for "already migrated, don't touch it
//! again". That has a dead end: `tauri-plugin-window-state` writes
//! `.window-state.json` into `app_config_dir()` on *every* exit,
//! regardless of whether migration ever ran or succeeded. If migration
//! fails (or the process is killed before it runs at all), the app still
//! starts and still exits, `new_dir` ends up with exactly one file that
//! has nothing to do with migration, and the next launch would read
//! "`new_dir` non-empty" as "already migrated" and never try again —
//! silently orphaning the old preferences/session/hot-exit backups
//! forever, with no further error and no further chance to recover.
//!
//! [`migrate`] instead makes the decision exactly once and records it
//! durably in a marker file (`<new_dir>.migration-complete`, sibling of
//! `new_dir`) before ever treating it as final:
//!
//! | marker | `old_dir` | `new_dir`  | action |
//! |--------|-----------|------------|--------|
//! | present | — | — | already decided; no-op |
//! | absent | absent | — | fresh install; write marker, no-op otherwise |
//! | absent | present | empty/absent | full transfer ([`migrate_dir`]); write marker |
//! | absent | present | **non-empty** | merge-recover ([`merge_recover`]): copy only what `new_dir` doesn't already have, never overwrite; write marker |
//!
//! The last row is what closes the dead end above: finding `new_dir`
//! non-empty with no marker no longer means "someone else already
//! migrated, leave it alone" — it means "something (typically
//! window-state) wrote here without migration having completed", so the
//! old data still needs recovering, just without clobbering whatever's
//! already there.
//!
//! ## Durability
//!
//! Every file this module writes is `fsync`'d individually before the
//! operation that depends on it (verification, or the marker being
//! considered written) proceeds. Where that file lands matters just as
//! much as the sync itself:
//!
//! - Full-transfer ([`migrate_dir`]) copies into the `.partial` staging
//!   directory, which is wholly discarded and rebuilt from scratch on any
//!   retry — a torn file left there by a crash is simply never looked at
//!   again, so a plain `fsync`-after-copy ([`copy_file_synced`]) is enough.
//! - Merge-recovery ([`merge_recover`]) writes directly into the *live*
//!   `new_dir`, which is never discarded and whose "already exists" state
//!   is exactly the never-overwrite signal the whole merge is built on. A
//!   crash mid-copy there would otherwise leave a file that exists (at its
//!   final name) but is truncated, which a later run would then protect
//!   forever as if it were real data. So every merge-copied file instead
//!   lands via [`copy_file_atomic_no_overwrite`]: written to a
//!   same-directory `<name>.merge-tmp`, `fsync`'d, then `rename`'d onto the
//!   final path only once complete. A crash can now only ever leave the
//!   *temp* file torn — recognizable by its suffix, discarded and retried
//!   on the next run — never the final one.
//!
//! The renames that make a decision final — the `.partial` → `new_dir`
//! publish, each merge-copied file's temp → final rename, `old_dir` →
//! `.migrated` retirement, and the marker's own temp-file → final-name
//! rename (via `crate::atomic_write`) — are, for the three *directory*-level
//! ones, each followed by an `fsync` of their parent directory on Unix, so
//! the directory entry change itself survives a crash immediately after.
//! Windows has no directory-fsync API (`FlushFileBuffers` doesn't support
//! directory handles portably across Windows versions), so that half is
//! `#[cfg(unix)]` and documented best-effort on Windows: the file-level
//! syncs still apply there, only the "rename itself is crash-durable"
//! guarantee is unavailable.
//!
//! ## Concurrency: two instances of *this* build racing to migrate
//!
//! [`run`] moves the whole decision ahead of `tauri::Builder` (see its own
//! doc), which means it runs before `tauri-plugin-single-instance`
//! (Windows/Linux) has registered its own guard — and macOS has no such
//! plugin in this codebase regardless. Two processes of this same build
//! can therefore both reach [`migrate`] at once. [`migrate_locked`] closes
//! that race with a blocking OS-level advisory lock (`std::fs::File::lock`,
//! stable since Rust 1.89 — this repo has no MSRV pin and CI installs
//! current `stable`, so no new dependency was needed) held for the whole
//! decision: the second process simply waits for the first to finish, and
//! by the time it acquires the lock the first's marker (if migration
//! completed) already exists, so it sees
//! [`MigrationOutcome::AlreadyDecided`] and does nothing. See
//! [`migrate_locked`]'s doc for the concrete data-loss scenario this
//! prevents.
//!
//! ## Known limitation: concurrent old + new *installs*
//!
//! The lock above only helps two processes of *this* build coordinate —
//! it says nothing about an old-identifier (`app.plume.editor`) install of
//! the pre-rename app running at the same time. The old and new builds use
//! different identifiers, so `tauri-plugin-single-instance`'s lock key
//! differs between them too, and the old binary has no idea this lock file
//! exists at all. If both happen to write to `old_dir`/`new_dir`
//! concurrently their writes can still interleave. Not guarded against
//! here (doing so would require changes to a binary that's already
//! shipped); mitigated operationally by telling users in release notes to
//! close the old install before launching this one.

///   - If `new_dir` exists by now (regardless of why, or whether it's

///   migrated".
///
///   **Why re-check and branch, instead of always clearing `new_dir` and

///   (potentially slow) copy, and nothing since holds any lock over
///   *ordinary* app writes — only concurrent *migration* attempts
///   (`migrate_locked`'s OS lock; see the module doc's Concurrency
///   section). If an earlier instance already gave up on migration (a
///   `NotStarted` failure) and is now simply running with fresh state, its
///   regular prefs/session/backup writes don't hold that lock, so
///   `new_dir` can go from empty to genuinely populated with live data —
///   or even just come into existence — while this call was busy copying
///   `old_dir` into `.partial`. Earlier versions of this function handled
///   that by clearing `new_dir` before the rename (first `remove_dir_all`
///   after a re-check, then the kernel-atomic non-recursive `remove_dir`)
///   — but *any* delete-then-publish sequence here is fixing the wrong
///   problem: the live data that raced the copy deserves to be merged in,
///   not raced against and either destroyed or left to a rename that
///   might silently replace it (POSIX `rename(2)` can atomically replace
///   an existing *empty* directory — so even a narrow "check empty, then
///   rename" gap could still silently swallow a writer's freshly-created,
///   momentarily-empty `new_dir`). Merging instead of ever
///   replacing/deleting anything at `new_dir` removes this whole class of
///   race from the function, rather than narrowing the window.
///
///   (Investigated and rejected as an alternative: Unix-only `renameat2`
///   `RENAME_NOREPLACE` / macOS `renamex_np` `RENAME_EXCL` would give a
///   truly atomic no-clobber directory rename — but neither is exposed by
///   `std`, both would need raw libc/unsafe FFI, and neither has a
///   portable Windows equivalent, so a working solution would still need
///   this same merge fallback there regardless. Not worth the added
///   unsafe surface for platforms this project doesn't even ship if the
///   safe, already-available fallback covers Tier 1 correctly on its
///   own.)
///
///   One residual, vanishingly narrow gap remains, inherent to any
///   "check absence, then create" sequence without a lock spanning both:
///   between the re-check finding `new_dir` absent and the `rename` call
///   immediately after, something could still create it. If that
///   something is empty at that exact instant, POSIX `rename` could
///   replace it before it gets used for anything; if non-empty, the
///   rename simply fails and is handled as a `NotStarted` abort like any
///   other publish failure. This mirrors the equally narrow gap the
///   `remove_dir` design this replaced had (two back-to-back syscalls,
///   no I/O-bound work in between) — empirically confirmed too
///   unreliable to construct as a deterministic test (a prior attempt at
///   an analogous gap lost the race to a background writer roughly 1 run
///   in 10), and not closable without a portable atomic no-clobber
///   directory-rename primitive, which — as above — doesn't exist in
///   `std` and isn't worth an unsafe, Tier-1-only libc dependency to add.
/// - If the copy or verification fails: `.partial` is removed, `old_dir`
///   is left exactly as found, and [`MigrationError::NotStarted`]
///   describes the failure. If the merge-publish branch's own copy or
