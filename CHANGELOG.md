# Changelog

All notable changes to Plume are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Plume is pre-1.0 (alpha); version numbers do not yet carry strict
Semantic Versioning compatibility guarantees.

## [v0.6.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Document Info dialog (File > Document Info): a read-only view of a
  file's facts — size and modified time, encoding with the detection
  evidence behind it, BOM, line-ending distribution (LF / CRLF / CR
  counts), and text stats. For files beyond 10 MB, the line-ending count
  is clearly labeled as scanned from a leading sample rather than shown
  as an unlabeled partial total.
- Command Palette (Mod+Shift+P): a fuzzy-searchable list of every menu
  command, for fast keyboard-driven access without hunting through
  menus.
- Two new Line Operations: Join Lines and Reverse Lines.
- Two new sort variants for Line Operations: case-insensitive sort and
  numeric sort (sorts by the first number found in each line).
- Clear Recently Opened (File menu): empties the recent-files list; the
  item enables and disables itself as the list fills and empties.
- Mojibake repair wizard: added a windows-1252 ⇄ EUC-JP repair
  hypothesis.
- Encoding-detection diagnostics now disclose when a verdict for a large
  file was based on a truncated sample rather than the whole file.
- A features guide (docs/features.md) documenting every encoding and
  large-file tool, and this changelog.

### Fixed

- Excluded ISO-2022-JP from large-file chunk paging: paging to a new
  chunk reset the decoder's shift-state, which could silently misread
  Japanese two-byte text as plain ASCII; also corrected cross-page
  boundary trimming for other legacy multi-byte encodings.
- Closed a cluster of save/reload race conditions: Save with Encoding,
  deferred saves, and reload/reopen confirmations could apply to the
  wrong tab, drop a pending save, misjudge read-only state, or reuse a
  stale encoding after concurrent edits, tab switches, or external file
  changes landed mid-operation.
- Find in Files: malformed decodes are now surfaced instead of silently
  treated as clean results, stale results from a superseded search are
  discarded, and per-file reads are bounded with scan errors surfaced
  instead of skipped silently.
- Four previously-silent failure paths now tell the user what happened:
  an unreadable hot-exit backup, a failed orphan-backup scan, files
  passed from the OS that could not be taken over, and a Preferences
  save failure (the dialog now stays open for a retry instead of
  closing as if it had succeeded).

## [v0.5.0-alpha.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Save with Encoding no longer misjudges a file after an
  external-change-triggered reload while the new encoding hasn't been
  written yet.
- Toggling line-ending settings mid-save is no longer misreported as
  saved.
- Content typed while waiting on a Reload / Reopen with Encoding
  confirmation is no longer silently overwritten — the app now always
  asks.
- Unicode Normalize no longer applies to the wrong tab or overwrites
  newer edits if the tab is switched or edited again while its
  confirmation is pending.
- Find in Files line numbers and jump-to-line are now correct for
  Classic Mac (CR-only line ending) files.
- Large-file conversion and replace operations now correctly refresh or
  notify a tab that was closed while the operation was running.
- Line-ending changes are now reflected immediately in the title bar and
  included in hot-exit backups.
- Explicit legacy-encoding (e.g. Big5) large-file preview windows no
  longer misreport malformed bytes at the window boundary.
- Find in Files and Replace in Files now honor the per-extension
  default-encoding preference.
- Batch conversion reports now flag byte drift on files where only the
  line ending changed.
- Large-file replace completion messages now explain when an unmatched
  region was re-encoded for technical reasons.

### Added

- Mojibake repair wizard: added a Cyrillic misdetection hypothesis
  (windows-1251 opened as KOI8-R).

## [v0.5.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Replace in Files: folder-scoped search and replace, with a dry-run
  preview (per-file hit counts, encoding, and risk flags), per-file
  checkboxes, and a strong confirmation before the destructive apply
  step. Only lines that actually change are re-encoded; every other
  line, including its original line ending, is preserved byte-for-byte.
- Encoding picker expanded from 11 to 27 entries: the windows-125x
  family, common ISO-8859 members, KOI8-R/U, windows-874 (Thai), and Mac
  Roman, presented in grouped sections.
- Reopen closed tab (Mod+Shift+T), restoring cursor position, with a
  per-session stack.
- Tab context menu: Close Others, Close to the Right, Copy Path, and
  Reveal in Finder/Explorer.
- Go to Line now accepts a `line:column` syntax, including in large-file
  mode.
- Find/replace history now covers the Find in Files panel as well.
- New `docs/encoding-detection.md` explaining which encodings can be
  auto-detected versus require manual selection; the detection
  diagnostics popup links to it.
- README gained an Install section, including instructions for the
  unsigned build.
- A chunk-paging property-based fuzz test now guards large-file offset
  arithmetic against regressions.

### Fixed

- Closed the remaining gaps in save-path byte fidelity, delivered in
  three stages: unmatched regions in large-file streaming replace are
  now preserved byte-for-byte instead of being silently re-encoded; a
  file containing legacy byte sequences that can't round-trip
  byte-for-byte now gets a one-time, informed confirmation before the
  first save; batch conversion's dry-run report flags files that would
  drift at the byte level even when the conversion is otherwise a no-op.
- Saving and an external-change reload no longer interfere with each
  other — a save in flight and a reload/second save now queue correctly
  instead of producing an orphaned backup or a false "changed on disk"
  warning.
- Large-file paging and go-to-line jumps no longer silently fail while a
  background chunk load is in flight.
- Fixed false decode-error reports at large-file preview window
  boundaries when an explicit UTF-8 encoding is selected.
- Batch scan and Find in Files no longer swallow directory-walk errors —
  unreadable subtrees are now reported instead of silently skipped.

## [v0.4.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Character inspector: a status-bar codepoint (U+XXXX) readout for the
  character at the cursor, with a popup showing its actual byte sequence
  under the file's save encoding.
- Invisible/ambiguous character audit: highlights bidi control
  characters, zero-width characters, NBSP variants, and in-body BOMs,
  with a status-bar count and a View-menu toggle.
- Unicode normalization: non-NFC detection plus a Normalize to NFC/NFD
  command that previews the number of affected sequences and verifies
  the result stays representable in the file's save encoding first —
  normalization can never set up a lossy save.
- Lossy-save character preview: when a save is rejected because some
  characters can't be encoded, the dialog now lists which characters and
  where, not just a bare warning.
- Full-width to half-width conversion and back, scoped to the current
  selection (Edit menu).
- Streaming encoding conversion for large files (over 10 MB): convert in
  place with an atomic write and the same two-stage lossy-save
  confirmation as a normal save.
- Multi-cursor commands (Select Next/All Occurrences) exposed in the
  Edit menu.
- Line move up/down, duplicate, and delete exposed in the Edit menu.
- Word/character/line count in the status bar — selection-aware and
  CJK-aware, hidden in large-file preview windows.
- Tab drag-to-reorder.
- Per-tab read-only mode (View menu and status-bar indicator).
- Indentation tools: detected indentation style (tabs vs. spaces, width)
  shown in the status bar, and Edit-menu commands to convert leading
  tabs ⇄ spaces.
- Expanded round-trip fuzz testing across all ten supported encodings,
  plus mojibake-repair reversibility fuzzing.

### Fixed

- Saves now validate a commit-time file fingerprint first, so an
  externally modified file can no longer be silently overwritten by a
  stale in-memory copy — applied consistently across normal save, batch
  conversion, and streaming replace.
- Edits made while a save is still in flight now correctly keep the tab
  marked dirty instead of being marked saved prematurely.
- Reload and reopen-with-encoding now drop the tab's hot-exit backup
  once its buffer is replaced by on-disk content, so a previously
  discarded edit can no longer resurface as a spurious dirty tab after a
  relaunch.
- Batch conversion's file-size guard is no longer a check-then-read
  race — the actual bytes read are now capped regardless of how much the
  file grows after the check.
- Batch scan and streaming operations no longer skip content on a line
  that exceeds the paging chunk size, and no longer silently swallow
  unreadable-subdirectory errors.
- Unified line-boundary handling (LF / CRLF / lone CR) between the
  large-file line index and chunk-paging alignment, fixing incorrect
  go-to-line, bookmark, and paging behavior in Classic Mac and
  mixed-line-ending files.
- Large-file chunk responses are now generation-guarded, so a slow or
  superseded paging/goto/bookmark response can no longer clobber the
  buffer with stale content after a newer request or a reload.

## [v0.3.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Mojibake repair wizard: detects common mis-decode round-trips and
  offers a previewed, reversible repair.
- Batch encoding conversion for a folder, with a dry-run report before
  any file is written and atomic per-file saves; batch line-ending
  conversion rides the same UI.
- Side-by-side encoding preview: the same bytes decoded under two
  candidate encodings, for manual disambiguation.
- Streaming find/replace inside large-file windows, searching and
  replacing across the full file.
- Line-offset index for large files, enabling fast go-to-line and
  bookmarks beyond the currently loaded window.
- Code folding.
- Line operations (Edit menu): sort, unique, trim trailing whitespace,
  and upper/lower case conversion.
- Indent guides.
- Issue templates, labels, and a good-first-issue starter set for
  contributors.
- Japanese (ja) and Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) UI translations.

### Fixed

- A save with characters that can't be represented in the target
  encoding now requires explicit confirmation before anything is
  written, instead of writing a partially-lossy file.
- Open and file-diagnostics commands no longer read an entire large file
  into memory.
- Fixed a UTF-16 large-file preview truncation bug that produced a false
  decode warning.
- A per-extension UTF-16 encoding preference could incorrectly hijack
  legitimate UTF-8/ASCII content; fixed.
- Session index writes are now atomic, with orphaned hot-exit backups
  recovered instead of lost.
- A hot-exit backup write failure no longer silently allows the window
  to close.

### Security

- Atomic saves now create their temp file with an exclusive-create
  flag, closing a symlink pre-planting attack on the save path.

## [v0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Full visual refresh: a semantic design-token system (color, spacing,
  radius, shadow, type scale) driving both the UI chrome and a new
  token-based CodeMirror editor theme.
- Built-in theme system (paper and dusk, alongside the existing
  light/dark/system options), switchable from the View menu.
- UI translated to Traditional Chinese (zh-TW first), including native
  menus, with English fallback following the system locale.
- Show Invisibles toggle (spaces, tabs, and end-of-line marks), View
  menu.
- Hex/bytes preview for undecodable files, offered from the
  decode-warning UI.
- Per-extension default encoding preference (falls back when detection
  isn't confident).
- Find/replace history dropdown.
- Encoding-detection diagnostics: a status-bar popup explaining the
  evidence behind a detected encoding (BOM found, statistical verdict).
- Startup-time budget script for tracking cold-start regressions
  locally.

### Fixed

- Selection contrast and markup syntax highlighting corrected on
  WKWebView (macOS).

## [v0.1.0-alpha.7] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Hot exit: unsaved buffers, including untitled tabs, are backed up
  continuously; closing the window never asks about unsaved changes,
  and content, tab titles, cursor position, and encoding settings are
  all restored on the next launch.
- Large-file paging: chunked navigation via status-bar Prev/Next
  controls, forward continuous-scroll auto-loading, and bidirectional
  continuous scrolling with a constant ~16 MB sliding window.
- Atomic saves (temp file + rename) — an interrupted save can no longer
  leave a corrupted file.
- Printing, via a native print dialog and a full-document print view.
- Regex mode for Find in Files.
- Word wrap toggle (View menu, persisted preference).
- Editor zoom shortcuts (Zoom In / Out / Actual Size).
- A Save option in the close-tab confirmation (Save / Don't Save /
  Cancel).
- Window size and position are now remembered across launches.
- Session restore now includes per-file cursor position.

## [v0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Multi-tab editing: open, save, and save-as, with an unsaved-changes
  indicator and close confirmation.
- Automatic encoding detection (BOM sniffing plus statistical
  detection) covering UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16 LE/BE, Big5, Shift_JIS,
  GB18030, and more.
- Decode-error surfacing — malformed text is never silently rendered as
  if it were fine.
- Reopen and Save with an explicitly chosen encoding, including a BOM
  toggle.
- Line-ending detection (LF / CRLF / Mixed), with display and
  conversion.
- Syntax highlighting, loaded on demand per language.
- Find/replace with regex support, and encoding-aware find in files.
- Go to Line, session restore on launch, and a recent-files quick-open
  panel (Mod+P).
- Native macOS menu bar and Windows menu, with platform-correct
  keyboard shortcuts.
- Preferences: font, font size, theme (system/light/dark), and default
  encoding for new files.
- File-association ("Open with") registration, command-line file
  opening, and single-instance forwarding.
- Auto-reload when an open file changes on disk, with a confirmation
  prompt if the tab has unsaved changes.
- Read-only preview mode for files over 10 MB, avoiding WebView freezes
  and accidental overwrites of huge files.
