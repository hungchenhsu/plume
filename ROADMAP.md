# Roadmap

This roadmap is deliberately narrow. The goal of v0.1 is a tool you can genuinely use every day to open, read, and edit text files — not half an IDE.

## North star

> Open a text file faster than an IDE. Handle legacy encodings more reliably than most modern editors. Feel native on macOS — and on Windows.

## v0.1 — MVP

**Editing**
- [x] Multi-tab open / save / save-as
- [x] Single-document open / save / save-as (skeleton)
- [x] Unsaved-changes indicator and close confirmation

**Encoding (the core identity)**
- [x] Automatic detection: BOM sniffing + statistical detection (UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16 LE/BE, Big5, Shift_JIS, GB18030, …)
- [x] Decode-error surfacing (never silently show mojibake as if it were fine)
- [x] Reopen with explicit encoding (UI)
- [x] Save with explicit encoding / BOM toggle (UI)
- [x] Line-ending detection (LF / CRLF / Mixed) and re-application on save
- [x] Line-ending conversion (UI)

**Editor basics**
- [x] Syntax highlighting for common languages
- [x] Find / replace with regex
- [x] Session restore (reopen last files on launch)

**Platform integration**
- [x] macOS native menu bar with standard shortcuts
- [x] Windows menu and Ctrl-based shortcuts
- [x] File association / "Open with" registration
- [x] Basic preferences (font, font size, theme, default encoding behavior)

## Post-MVP candidates

Ordered roughly by likelihood, not commitment:

- Large-file mode (Rust-side chunked loading, read-only first)
- Find in files (Rust search backend)
- Recent files / quick open
- Column (rectangular) selection
- Drag-and-drop file opening
- Auto-reload on external change (file watcher)
- Printing

## Explicit non-goals

These are out of scope — not "later", but **not what this project is**:

- Plugin system / scripting / macros
- Project panels, file trees, workspace management
- Integrated terminal, debugger, LSP-based intelligence
- FTP/SFTP browsing
- Trying to replace your IDE

## Platform tiers

- **Tier 1:** macOS, Windows — feature parity, CI-built and tested, platform-correct UX on each.
- **Tier 2:** Linux — kept compiling and functional via Tauri (WebKitGTK), but not UX-polished; community contributions welcome.
